# Front-End-Challenges
I personally design and create this repo as a way to store all my work that are relevant to front end coding challenges, exercises, and UI problems from jobs that I have applied until present. I have obtained these exercises or challenges from various website such as https://frontendeval.com/ and https://www.frontendmentor.io/ in order to develop UI components using front end technologies and React JS. I will update and add it accordingly as the time goes.  

## 1. FAQ
The FAQ component is built using HTML5 elements and React JS.
