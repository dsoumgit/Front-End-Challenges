# Projects & Front-End-Challenges
I personally design and create this repo as a way to store all my work that are relevant to front end coding challenges, exercises, and UI problems from jobs that I have applied until present. I have obtained these exercises or challenges from various website such as https://frontendeval.com/ and https://www.frontendmentor.io/ in order to develop UI components using front end technologies and React JS. I will update and add it accordingly as the time goes.  

## 1. FAQ

## 5. Challenger Mission Management
Develop a mission management system to allow the headquarters to input and aggregate data about center's missions and to receive feedback from programs' participants.
The application allows the headquarters to see the reports about number of students who have participated in different missions and STEM education on interactive charts. It provides a way to filter based on each mission and group by date or any other filter item based on the user needs.
