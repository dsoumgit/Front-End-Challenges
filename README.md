# Front-End-Challenges
This repo stores all the work that are related to front end exercises and coding challenges. I use websites like https://frontendeval.com/ and https://www.frontendmentor.io/ to develop UI components using front end technologies and React JS. 

## 1. FAQ
The FAQ component is built using HTML5 elements and React JS.
